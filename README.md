# Web-Crawler-with-custom-ranking
In this project we have created a search engine using java which is more fast and efficient. This is the web crawler which goes to a fixed depth only and crawls every web page from the base URL. I have also applied a custom ranking model to rank the webpages taking into consideration outlinks, inlinks and similarity.  We have applied concept of dynamic ranking to rank the web pages.
